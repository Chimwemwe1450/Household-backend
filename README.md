Steps to Set Up and Run Your PHP Backend Using XAMPP
1. Download and Install XAMPP
Visit the official XAMPP website.
Download the appropriate version for your operating system.
Install XAMPP, ensuring that Apache and MySQL components are selected during installation.
2. Start XAMPP and Configure Apache
Open the XAMPP Control Panel.
Start the Apache service by clicking the Start button next to it.
If you plan to use a database, start MySQL as well.
3. Set Up Your PHP Project
Navigate to your XAMPP installation folder (default: C:\xampp).

Open the htdocs directory.

Create a new folder for your project, e.g., phpscript. Your folder structure should look like this:
C:\xampp\htdocs\phpscript.

Add your PHP script files to this folder. For example:

C:\xampp\htdocs\phpscript\index.php.
4. Run Your PHP Script
Open your web browser.
Type the URL in the address bar:
http://localhost/phpscript/index.php.
Your PHP script should execute, and the result will display in the browser.
